### Automatic Updates via Sparkle — **Stay Fresh!** (2025-11-18)

Warden now supports automatic updates with zero user effort:

- 🔄 **Auto-Check**: Checks for new versions every hour automatically
- 🔔 **Notifications**: Users get notified when updates are available
- 🚀 **Seamless Installation**: Updates download and install in the background
- 🎯 **Manual Check**: "Check for Updates..." option in the About menu for on-demand checks
- 🛡️ **Secure**: Updates are signed with EdDSA signatures for verification
- 📋 **Release Notes**: Beautiful formatted release notes shown before updating

**For Developers:**
- `UpdaterManager.swift` handles all Sparkle integration
- `appcast.xml` is the release feed (hosted on GitHub)
- `SPARKLE_SETUP.md` has detailed setup instructions for first-time key generation
- `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` documents the complete release workflow
- `scripts/create_sparkle_signature.sh` helper for generating update signatures
- All configuration in `Info.plist` (SUFeedURL, SUShowReleaseNotes, etc.)

**Workflow:**
1. Build and notarize the new version
2. Create GitHub release with the notarized DMG
3. Generate signature for the DMG
4. Update `appcast.xml` with release details
5. Push to main — users automatically notified and can update

## 🗑️ Removed

### Spotlight Integration — **Bye Bye!** (2025-11-18)

We ripped out the entire Spotlight indexing feature. Here's what went away:

- 🔍 Deleted the `SpotlightIndexManager` utility class
- 📚 Removed CoreSpotlight framework (one less dependency to worry about)
- 🧹 Cleaned up Spotlight references from:
  - `ChatStore.swift` — removed indexing methods and background tasks
  - `WardenApp.swift` — removed search handler and activity continuation
  - `ContentView.swift` — removed notification listeners
  - Various UI files (`ProjectSummaryView`, `ChatListRow`, `ProjectListView`)
- 🗄️ Removed Spotlight attributes from the Core Data model

**Why?** Smaller app size, fewer background processes running, cleaner codebase. And don't worry — this was super internal stuff. You won't miss it.

## ✨ Changed

### Message Bubbles & Avatars — **Better Visual Hierarchy!** (2025-11-19)

Enhanced message appearance with provider identification and user avatars:

- 👤 **User avatars**: Cute circular avatars with accent color on outgoing messages
- 🤖 **AI provider logos**: Provider-specific icons on incoming messages (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- 🎨 **User bubble color**: Changed to subtle accent color tint for better visual cohesion
- ✨ **AI bubble icons**: Smart icon selection based on API provider type

### Message Input Box — **No Weird Tint!** (2025-11-19)

- 🎨 Removed material backgrounds that caused unwanted tinting
- ✨ Switched to clean control background color for consistent appearance
- 📝 Applied fix across input container, bottom container, and chat view

### Model Selector — **Cleaner UI!** (2025-11-18)

The model selector just got a facelift. Everything's now in one convenient dropdown:

- 📌 Favorites and Recently Used sections moved inside the dropdown
- ➖ Removed the separate Favorites toolbar button
- 🎯 No more filter toggle buttons cluttering the header
- ✨ Sections appear at the top of the dropdown when you're not searching
- **Result:** Way cleaner, easier to use

### Model Pricing — **Now Live!** (2025-11-18)

Models now show pricing information right in the interface:

- 💰 Live pricing fetched from OpenRouter API
- 🏷️ Shows pricing like `$0.001/1M` with cute cost indicators (`$` / `$$` / `$$$`)
- 📊 Different fetchers for different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, etc.)
- 🏠 Self-hosted providers (Groq, Ollama, LMStudio) marked as free
- ⚠️ Staleness warning if pricing data is older than 30 days
- 📋 Source attribution so you know where the data came from

### Model Selector Performance — **Turbocharged!** (2025-11-18)

We made things a lot snappier when you're browsing models:

- ⚡ Pre-calculate model scores instead of recalculating during sorting
- 💾 Cache search text lowercasing (no repeated string transformations)
- 🎯 Pre-calculate metadata and favorite status to avoid multiple lookups
- 🚀 Early exit optimization for favorited models
- **Result:** Scrolling through 100+ models is now buttery smooth with way less memory overhead

### Button Styling — **Fresh & Modern** (2025-11-18)

All the buttons got a style upgrade:

- 🔘 Rounded corners now 8-10px for that soft, modern look
- ✋ Hover effects with subtle scale animations (1.02x on hover, 0.97x when pressed)
- 🎨 Enhanced shadows and material backgrounds for better visual feedback
- 🆕 New `ModernButton.swift` component with primary, secondary, tertiary, and destructive variants for future use
- **Updated buttons:** ToolbarButton, RephraseButton, FavoriteQuickAccessBar, ThemeMode, and more
