# 🔐 Warden 0.6 — Fresh, Smooth, and Speedy

Warden just got a major glow-up! We've made it prettier, faster, and way more reliable. Your chats are about to feel buttery smooth.

## 🎉 The Vibe

Warden 0.6 is all about making your AI experience feel *premium*. Less clutter. More polish. Faster performance. And now you can search the web without leaving the app. Pretty cool, right?

## 🚨 Before You Update

**Please back up your data first.** I've restructured the database under the hood (nothing scary!), and your existing chats will automatically migrate to the new system when you first open the app. Everything should work seamlessly, but it's always good to be safe.

## ✨ What's New & Exciting

### 🌐 Web Search — See the Internet in Real-Time

Your AI can now search the web! Perfect for getting current info, latest news, or breaking through knowledge cutoffs.

- **Search when you need it** — Toggle web search on or off for each message
- **See your sources** — Results show up as clickable links right in the response
- **Easy setup** — Just add your Tavily API key in preferences and you're good to go

### 🎨 The UI Got a Makeover

We redesigned the entire interface from the ground up. It's now cleaner, more consistent, and just *nicer* to look at:

- **Cleaner chat view** — Better spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
- **Streamlined settings** — Preferences are now flat, modern, and easier to navigate
- **Minimal model selector** — No more borders and clutter—just you and your AI
- **Better onboarding** — First time users get a simpler, cleaner introduction to Warden

### 🎬 Smooth Animations Everywhere

We added subtle, delightful animations that make the app feel responsive and alive:

- **Messages fade in smoothly** — No more jarring pops
- **Typing indicators dance** — Visual feedback while the AI thinks
- **Streaming pulses gently** — Know that something's happening without distraction
- **Buttons respond to clicks** — Satisfying micro-interactions throughout
- **Respects your preferences** — All animations vanish if you have "reduce motion" enabled

### ⚡ Under the Hood: Serious Speed & Stability Improvements

We spent a lot of time making Warden more reliable and efficient:

- **Database got an upgrade** — Faster lookups, smarter data handling
- **Backup & restore are faster** — More efficient processes
- **No more crashes** — Replaced fragile code with graceful, helpful error messages
- **Modern async code** — Cleaner patterns that prevent freezing and stuttering

## 🎯 What Stays the Same

Don't worry—we didn't break anything you love:

✅ All your existing chats are safe

✅ All your personas are intact

## ⚠️ Quick Notes
