-[x] Model Selector UI Change
-[x] New Project and Move to Project UI change: move-to-project view uses a full-width, single-column list with sensible sizing and scrolling; blank right-side space removed
-[x] Move to project popover/sheet sizing fixed: larger default size, scrollable, with inline “Create New Project” flow wired so new projects can be created and immediately selected
-[x] Faster/cleaner model selector: removed heavy/weird boundary, aligned trigger and popover styling with toolbar for a lightweight, responsive feel
-[x] First chat, it should be at the left side, response should be not in center, thinking should also be on the left side - COMPLETED
-[ ] Ul polishing
-[ ] Better handling of websearch, citations should be shown in line and hyperlinks should be clickable
-[ ] Clean code, too much code and not enough memory management
-[ ] Files should be smaller, like 300-lines of code per file, it's too much code and not enough memory management
-[ ] UI should be more consistent, like the chat list should be more consistent with the chat view
