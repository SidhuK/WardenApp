## Overview

Implement a Projects feature similar to ChatGPT and Claude that allows users to organize multiple chats into folders with shared context and custom instructions. Projects will include AI-generated summaries and descriptions to provide quick insights into project content and progress.

## Core Features to Implement

### 1. Project Structure

- **Folders for Organization**: Projects act as containers/folders that group related chats
- **Custom Instructions**: Project-specific AI persona instructions that apply to all chats within the project
- **Project Metadata**: Name, description, color coding, creation date, last modified
- **Chat Organization**: Move existing chats into projects, create new chats within projects
- **AI-Generated Summaries**: Automatic project descriptions and chat summaries using AI

### 2. Project Management Features

- **Project Creation/Deletion**: Create new projects with customizable settings
- **Project Navigation**: Easy switching between projects in sidebar
- **Project Settings**: Modify project instructions, name, color, and other settings
- **Import/Export**: Backup and restore project data
- **Search**: Search within project chats
- **AI Summarization**: Generate project overviews and chat summaries on demand

## Technical Considerations

### AI Summarization Strategy

- Use existing user's preferred AI service for consistency
- Implement smart batching to minimize API calls
- Cache summaries and refresh based on activity thresholds
- Support multiple summarization styles based on project type
- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

### Context Window Management

- Intelligently select relevant chat content for summarization
- Implement progressive summarization for large projects
- Prioritize recent activity and important conversations
- Respect AI model context limits while including comprehensive project data

### Data Migration Strategy

- Create migration path for existing users
- Default project for chats without explicit project assignment
- Gradual migration workflow in `DatabasePatcher.swift`
- Preserve existing chat history and relationships
- Generate initial summaries for migrated content

### Performance & Caching

- Cache AI-generated summaries to reduce API calls
- Implement smart refresh logic based on chat activity
- Background processing for summary generation
- Efficient storage of summary metadata and timestamps
