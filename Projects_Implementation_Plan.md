- **Chat Organization**: Move existing chats into projects, create new chats within projects
- **AI-Generated Summaries**: Automatic project descriptions and chat summaries using AI

### 2. Project Management Features

- **Project Creation/Deletion**: Create new projects with customizable settings
- **Project Navigation**: Easy switching between projects in sidebar
- **Project Settings**: Modify project instructions, name, color, and other settings
- **Import/Export**: Backup and restore project data
