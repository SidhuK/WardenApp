To add Sparkle to Warden, you'd need to:

Initial Setup:

Install Sparkle via CocoaPods or SPM
Add SUUpdater to your app delegate or main view
Configure feed URL pointing to your appcast.xml file
Set up code signing/notarization (required for Sparkle)
Create appcast.xml hosted on a server (GitHub releases, your own server, etc.)

Each Release:

Build, sign, and notarize the .app or .dmg
Upload the binary to your hosting
Update appcast.xml with:
New version number
Release notes
Download URL
File size & hash
Commit/push the updated appcast.xml
Users get automatic update notification

Easiest approach: Use GitHub releases + a simple appcast.xml hosted on GitHub, or use a service like BetaBlast/Sparkle-Hosted to handle the appcast hosting automatically.
